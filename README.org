** What are flashcards ? 

From Wikipedia: 

A flashcard or flash card is a card bearing information, as words or numbers, on either or both sides, used in classroom drills or in private study. One writes a question on a side and an answer overleaf. Flashcards can bear vocabulary, historical dates, formulae or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format. Flashcards are widely used as a learning drill to aid memorization. They are often associated with spaced repetition, i.e. reviewed at expanding time intervals. 

** What is Anki ? 

Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program.


** What is org-drill ? 

Org-Drill is an extension for Org mode. Org-Drill uses a spaced repetition algorithm to conduct interactive "drill sessions", using org files as sources of facts to be memorised.
